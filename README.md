The code has been written in R and UI is created using Shiny.
The user needs to input the topic and the number of tweets to be analysed.
api_key <- "Your API Key",
api_secret <- "Your API Key Secret" 
The above keys need to be generated by using Twitter apps inorder to fetch tweets from twitter.
Save all the 3 files in one folder and mention the path of the folder in run.R.
Word Cloud would be displayed for all the 3 scenarios.
